children:
  - title: "Dungeon: BSP Room Generation"
    body: |-
      Implement Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) to carve rectangular rooms connected by corridors.

      Acceptance:
      - Deterministic with seeded RNG
      - Configurable min/max room sizes and splits
      - Connectivity guaranteed
      - Unit tests for topology invariants
    labels: ["dungeon", "generation"]
  - title: "Dungeon: Cellular Automata Caverns"
    body: |-
      Implement cellular automata cave generation as an optional mode per floor.

      Acceptance:
      - Seeded / deterministic
      - Configurable birth/survival rules
      - Identify/keep largest connected component
    labels: ["dungeon", "generation"]
  - title: "Dungeon: Stairs Placement & Validation"
    body: |-
      Place up/down stairs with constraints:
      - Minimum Manhattan distance
      - On walkable tiles only
      - Reachability between stairs guaranteed
    labels: ["dungeon", "navigation"]
  - title: "Rendering: Tilemap & Sprite Atlas"
    body: |-
      Implement tile rendering pipeline and sprite atlas management for rooms/caverns, including layers for walls, floors, features.

      Acceptance:
      - Offscreen batch for performance
      - Depth-correct layering
      - Rendering tests via golden images (smoke)
    labels: ["rendering", "tilemap"]
  - title: "Navigation: Pathfinding & Movement"
    body: |-
      Implement grid-based pathfinding (A*/Dijkstra) and movement validation with collision against walls and features.

      Acceptance:
      - 4/8-direction modes
      - Costs configurable, tie-breakers deterministic
      - Unit tests on sample maps
    labels: ["navigation"]
  - title: "Map UI: Minimap & Fog of War"
    body: |-
      Implement minimap with fog-of-war reveal, icons for stairs, chests, and portals.

      Acceptance:
      - Explore/reveal radius configurable
      - Save/restore explored cells
      - Icons legend and toggle
